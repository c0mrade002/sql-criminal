SQL Protocols and Ports:
- Protocol: TCP/IP
- Default Port: 1433
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrative Details That Could Create Vulnerabilities:

1. Insufficient Access Permissions:
   Description: Inadequate access permissions to databases or objects within them can lead to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive data.
   
2. Weak or Default Passwords:
   Description: Using weak or default passwords for SQL accounts poses a significant security risk, as they are more susceptible to brute-force attacks.
   
3. Lack of Patching and Security Updates:
   Description: Failure to apply patches and security updates to the SQL Server software leaves the system vulnerable to known exploits and vulnerabilities.
   
4. Unnecessary Exposure of SQL Server:
   Description: Exposing the SQL server unnecessarily to the public network increases the attack surface and exposes it to potential threats from malicious actors.
   
5. Configuration Errors Allowing SQL Injection:
   Description: Configuration errors that allow the execution of malicious SQL queries (SQL injection) can lead to data breaches and compromise the integrity of the database.
   
6. Inadequate Monitoring and Logging:
   Description: Lack of robust monitoring and logging of database activities makes it difficult to detect and respond to suspicious behavior or security incidents.
   
7. Poor Control of Database Administrator Accounts:
   Description: Inadequate control over database administrator accounts and associated privileges can result in unauthorized access to critical database resources.
